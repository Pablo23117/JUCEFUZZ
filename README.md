# Welcome to Our JUCE Fuzz Harness

## Intro
We are a group of students at the University of Utah, where we learned how to fuzz and instrument a target using an open-source library or framework. 
For our project, we decided to fuzz test the JUCE framework, mainly some of the audio reader classes, and also some of the string parsing methods. 

## AFL++
To use the same setup as us, we recommend fuzzing with AFL++
