# Welcome to Our JUCE Fuzz Harness

## Intro
We are a group of students at the University of Utah who's goal was to learn how to fuzz and instrument a target from an open source library or framework. 
For our project, we decided to fuzz test the JUCE framework, mainly the _____ class and also some of the string parsing methods. 

## AFL++
To use the same setup as us, we recommend fuzzing with AFL++
